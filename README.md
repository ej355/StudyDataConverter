# StudyDataConverter

If you don't already have Java then you will need to download it (https://www.java.com/en/download/).

1. Download StudyDataConverter.jar and StudyDataConverter.bat and put them in the same folder.
2. Run StudyDataConverter.bat (double click)

You will be prompted for file names, unless the file is in the same folder as the above files then they will need a full file path.
e.g. C:\Users\me\myFile.txt

The output file will need to end in .csv
e.g. results.csv

If you want to use custom headers, they will need to correspond to the data in the file and be in csv format.
"AB, CD, EF, GH"

The file will appear in the same directory as the above files unless you specify otherwise.
